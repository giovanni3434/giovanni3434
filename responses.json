So instead of purchasing a system outright, we offer additional options that require little to zero upfront costs. The difference between a solar lease and solar PPA is simple: With a lease, you pay a fixed monthly “rent” in return for use of the system. With a PPA you pay a fixed price per kWh for power generated. We’ll help you decide which option is best for you. So now that you know what a solar lease and PPA is, you’re probably wondering why you shouldn’t just buy a home solar system outright. Here are a few reasons why: Get started for as little as $0 down. Skip the hassle of ownership. Sunrun will handle installation, maintenance, monitoring, and insurance for the life of the agreement.
